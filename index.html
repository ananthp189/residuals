					<p>This project was created for assessment in Information Visualisation (Level M) 2020/21 at University of Glasgow. The aim was to create visualisations for hiking trails in Washington State. By participating in this survey, you agree for the collected data to be used for evaluation of the visualisations. This survey is anonymous, we ask for age and gender for demographic analysis. The data will be held until class results publication on 2 September 2021. For any questions regarding this survey contact: 2207841m@student.gla.ac.uk</p>
